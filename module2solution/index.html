Explobers is a unique puzzle platformer that requires you to use multiple player characters to solve difficult challenges by using their powers (and lives) to destroy terrain and build blocks in order to navigate through over eighty tricky stages.

<!--The game begins in the familiar CGA palette of classic PCs. As you progress, new graphic modes become available and you may find some secrets!-->
